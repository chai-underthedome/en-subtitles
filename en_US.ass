Dialogue: 0,0:47:24.06,0:47:25.82,Default,,0,0,0,,I had to turn to the National People's Congress
Dialogue: 0,0:47:25.82,0:47:29.50,Default,,0,0,0,,So I called the NPC, and this was their reply:

Dialogue: 0,0:47:43.42,0:47:47.26,Default,,0,0,0,,They replied that because when they were making this law, many departments opposed it
Dialogue: 0,0:47:47.26,0:47:50.14,Default,,0,0,0,,saying that the MEP should not be in charge, so the bill could not pass
Dialogue: 0,0:47:50.14,0:47:53.14,Default,,0,0,0,,In the end the NPC had to use a vague term to make it pass
Dialogue: 0,0:47:53.14,0:47:55.22,Default,,0,0,0,,So only departments with executive authority can enforce this law
Dialogue: 0,0:47:55.22,0:47:58.78,Default,,0,0,0,,It sounds like all three departments are responsible for supervision, but in reality we cannot control it
Dialogue: 0,0:47:58.78,0:48:01.14,Default,,0,0,0,,Their certificates are all valid, and so are the vehicles' types
Dialogue: 0,0:48:01.14,0:48:03.70,Default,,0,0,0,,The MEP issues them green labels of National Standard 4

Dialogue: 0,0:48:07.34,0:48:10.54,Default,,0,0,0,,If you (the MEP) assert you have legal authority, no one can deny that, so why not just execute the law?

Dialogue: 0,0:48:13.82,0:48:16.02,Default,,0,0,0,,The situation is that we didn't pursue this issue further
Dialogue: 0,0:48:16.02,0:48:18.90,Default,,0,0,0,,So after so many years your law enforcement powers are still completely toothless?
Dialogue: 0,0:48:18.90,0:48:21.94,Default,,0,0,0,,Nowadays I don't dare open my mouth out of fear that people will see I have no teeth
